      <h2>Childhood</h2>
      <p>
        At the moment I entered the University I knew almost nothing about
        programming. And it is quite clearly, 'cause I spent most of my time
        preparing for the graduation exams. Moreover, I thought that in the
        University I would learn coding and then easily get a job, but except
        studying in the University I also studied by myself.

      <h2>Summer 2020</h2>
      <p>
        So in summer 2020 I decided to write my own site no matter what. I knew
        that I didn't have enough knowledge but I had to do something to move
        on. At first I decided to create a website with an authorization on
        nodeJS. After some time I did manage to create it but there were too
        many issues. Then I decided to recreate it and make it more responsible
        and comfortable.

        This server is written on nodeJS. Hope it will work much more better and
        without defects. As far as frontend is concerned, I have watched many
        videos from

        and other youtube bloggers. In my project I used code from this helpful
        videos, but I changed it in my own way. Now let you use it.
